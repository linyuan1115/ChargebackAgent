### Risk Scoring Methodology

The AI uses a comprehensive 0-100 risk scoring system with category-specific thresholds:

| **Category** | **Approve (â‰¤)** | **Review** | **Reject (â‰¥)** |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Fraud & Unauthorized** | 30 | 31-69 | 70 |
| **Processing Issues** | 40 | 41-79 | 80 |
| **Merchandise Issues** | 35 | 36-74* | 75 |

*Merchandise Issues in 36-74 range show "Send for Merchant Investigation"

### Transaction Legitimacy Factors

**For Fraud Cases:**
- Order history links = Suspicious (potential abusive chargeback)
- No history = Consistent with stolen card/identity theft

**For Merchandise/Processing Cases:**
- Order history links = Loyal customer (lower risk)
- No history = New customer (moderate risk)

### Key Risk Factors Analyzed
- **Customer Profile**: Credit score, dispute history, account tenure
- **Transaction Details**: Amount, merchant category, location
- **Evidence Quality**: Completeness and authenticity of documentation
- **Order History**: Same card, address, IP, device usage patterns
- **Temporal Patterns**: Transaction timing and frequency
